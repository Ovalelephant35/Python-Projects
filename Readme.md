## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of Python projects that are meant to be compatible with the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) development environment. Each project is organized in a way that takes advantage of the features and extensions provided by VS Code, making it easier for developers to work on the projects collaboratively.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured with different projects you can take a look in files.


Each project directory will contain the following:

- `.vscode`: This directory will include specific configurations and settings that optimize the development experience in VS Code for the project.
- `code`: This directory will hold the Python code for the project.
- `docs`: Here, you'll find project-specific documentation, explaining the concepts, algorithms, and methodologies used in the project.
- `resources`: Any additional resources, such as data files or images, required to run or understand the project.
